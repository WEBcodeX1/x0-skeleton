# Example: 01-forms-microesb

This example demonstrates how to integrate advanced form handling with a microESB (Enterprise Service Bus) pattern / implementation [python-micro-esb](https://github.com/clauspruefer/python-micro-esb) using the [x0](https://github.com/WEBcodeX1/x0) framework.

## Overview

The `01-forms-microesb` example showcases a microservice-like architecture in which form data is processed through an ESB-style message pipeline. It provides a reference implementation for:

- Creating and validating forms.
- Passing form data through the microESB.
- Modular message processing.
- Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and integration.

## Features

- **Form Creation & Validation**: Illustrates form field definitions and validation logic.
- **MicroESB Integration**: Shows how form submissions are routed through a simple ESB implementation.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add more processors or handlers to the ESB pipeline.
- **Decoupled Components**: UI and business logic are separated for maintainability and testability.

## Usage

1. **Run the example**
   The startup instructions depend on the main framework configuration. If a script is provided, run:

   ```bash
   ./activate
   ```
   or refer to the main repo documentation for custom commands.

2. **Explore the code**
   - Review the form definition and handling logic in `object.json` and `skeleton.json`.
   - Check how the ESB pipeline processes the form data.

## How It Works

- **Form Submission**: User fills out and submits the form.
- **Form Validation**: Complex form data directly gets validated in browser.
- **Message Routing**: Form data is encapsulated in a message and sent to the microESB.
- **Processing Pipeline**: The microESB routes the message through a sequence of processors (e.g., transformation, persistence).
- **Response**: The result is sent back to the UI.

## Customization

- You can add or modify processors in the microESB to handle custom business requirements.
- Adapt form fields and validation logic according to your application's needs.
